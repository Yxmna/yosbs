# Your Options Shall Be Saved (YOSBS)

Your Options Shall Be Saved (YOSBS) is a lightweight utility mod that lets modpack creators define default configuration files without overwriting player preferences.

Updating a modpack often resets custom settings like keybinds or mod configs, because most launchers replace the entire `config/` folder.

YOSBS solves this by copying any file placed in `config/yosbs/` to its proper location only once on first launch â€” and never again.

This gives full control to the pack author:

- Files inside `config/yosbs/` are treated as user-owned: copied once, then left untouched
- Files inside `config/` behave as usual: they will be replaced on each update

That way, you decide which configs should persist, and which should reset."

## Features
- **Zero-config**: just drop the defaults under `/config/yosbs/â€¦` (or legacy `/config/yosbr`)
- Works for **any** file â€“ `options.txt`, mod configs, `optionsshaders.txt`, etc
- Runs in the **pre-launch phase**, before Fabric/Forge starts loading the rest of the mods
